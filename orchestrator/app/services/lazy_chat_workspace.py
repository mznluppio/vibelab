"""Per-user default chat workspace — lazy-created on first chat.

Every chat (browser, API, gateway) must have a Project attached so that
agent tools needing project context — file I/O, bash, container control,
kanban, schedule, credential storage — always have a valid scope. A chat
with ``project_id IS NULL`` works for plain text Q&A but fails the moment
the agent calls any project-scoped tool, often with cryptic
"cannot resolve project path" errors from deep in the orchestrator.

To make those tool calls always-succeed without forcing the user to
pre-create a project, we lazily mint a single per-user workspace the
first time the user starts a project-less chat. It is:

- One row per user, ``name='~workspace~'``, ``project_kind='workspace'``,
  ``compute_tier='none'`` (no containers, no startup cost).
- Tied to the user's personal team so RBAC checks pass uniformly.
- Reusable as the home for CLI tool installations, credentials, and any
  runtime state the agent accumulates across sessions.

Sibling to ``services.automations.lazy_workspace`` (`~automations~`).
They are intentionally distinct: the automation workspace is the spend /
artifact home for scheduled tasks; this one is the general-purpose
default for ad-hoc chats. Keeping them separate avoids cross-feature
surprise when a user uses one but not the other.
