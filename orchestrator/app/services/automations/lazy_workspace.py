"""Per-user automation workspace project — lazy-created on first use.

The Phase 5 plan introduces a ``user_automation_workspace`` scope on
``automation_definitions``. When an automation with that scope fires for
the first time the dispatcher needs *some* Project to attribute spend,
files, and run artifacts to. Rather than pre-creating one for every
user at signup (most users never trigger an automation that needs one),
the workspace is created lazily by this helper.

Lazy invariants:

- Exactly one row per user with ``name='~automations~'``,
  ``project_kind='workspace'``, ``compute_tier='none'``.
- Idempotent: a second call returns the same row without inserting.
- Tied to the user's personal team so RBAC checks pass uniformly.
- Empty ``default_contract_template={}`` — the user can fill it later.

Callers (Phase 5 onward):

- ``services.automations.dispatcher`` — when the resolved
  ``workspace_scope`` is ``user_automation_workspace`` and the
  definition's ``workspace_project_id`` is NULL.
- DO NOT call from signup, login, or any "warm-up" hook. The whole
  point is "lazy on first use".

section "Workspace model".
