"""Seed the two immutable system marketplace sources.

This seed is the safety net for the federated-marketplace source registry.
The alembic migration ``0088_marketplace_sources`` creates the rows on first
upgrade with deterministic UUIDs; this seed runs on every boot and:

  - reasserts existence (idempotent UPSERT by handle) for environments
    that bypassed migrations or restored from a partial backup;
  - refreshes mutable fields (display_name, base_url) so a redeploy can
    update branding/URLs without a migration;
  - never modifies trust_level, scope, or pinned_hub_id — those are
    structural and would change federation semantics.

Cloud-mode user/team scoped Local sources are NOT seeded here; they are
created lazily on first draft save by the marketplace_sources router
(Wave 5). This file only owns the two system rows.
