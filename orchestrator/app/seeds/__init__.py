Database seed scripts for initial data population.

After Wave 10 the orchestrator no longer carries any marketplace catalog
seeds. The federation sync worker (``services.marketplace_sync``) is the
sole population path for catalog rows on fresh deploys — it pulls items
from each registered ``MarketplaceSource`` and upserts them into the
local cache tables, tagging every row with ``source_id`` and
``source_etag``.

This module is intentionally narrow now. It owns only:

  * ``seed_marketplace_sources`` — the two immutable system rows
    (``Tesslate Official`` + ``Local``) that anchor every other catalog
    write. Mirrors the alembic 0088 migration so a DB restored from a
    partial backup or a fresh-table-creation environment still ends up
    with a valid source registry.
  * ``seed_deployment_targets`` — system-managed deployment provider
    catalog (``item_type='deployment_target'``). NOT a federated
    marketplace primitive; lives orchestrator-side because the deploy
    pipeline routes through it directly.
  * ``seed_system_default_agent`` — the pseudo-row backing the
    code-resident system default agent. Identity + config live in
    ``services.default_agent``; this seed plants (and re-asserts on
    every boot) the single ``marketplace_agents`` row so FKs from
    ``user_purchased_agents`` etc. resolve. Replaces the old per-user
    ``auto_add_tesslate_agent_to_users`` sweep — the default is now
    derived in the listing endpoint, not stored per-user.
  * Library auto-add backfill for *helper* canonical agents (Librarian,
    Agent Builder, Assist to Build, Automation Builder, Service Integrator). These are
    separate from the system default; they remain real marketplace
    items every user gets nudged toward. The actual logic lives in
    ``services.library_seeder``.

All seed functions are idempotent and safe to run on every startup. Each
call is wrapped in its own try/except so one failure doesn't cascade.
