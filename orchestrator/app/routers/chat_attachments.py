"""Standalone-chat file-upload endpoint.

``POST /api/chats/{chat_id}/attachments`` (multipart, ``file`` field) streams
a single upload to the chat's attached workspace and INSERTs a
``ChatAttachment`` row with ``message_id=NULL``. The id is returned to the
frontend, which carries it back inside the next ``SerializedAttachment``
(``file_reference`` variant) so the orchestrator's chat-send handler can
patch ``message_id`` and the orphan GC leaves the row alone.

Constraints (project-wide convention — see
``services/gateway/runner.py:25``, ``services/channels/telegram.py:542``,
``services/channels/slack.py:408``):

* 25 MiB hard cap, enforced server-side. Returns 413
  ``{"code": "file_too_large", "max_bytes": 26214400}`` on overrun.
* No mime allowlist. Detected mime is recorded as metadata only.

Storage layout: ``<workspace_root>/.chat/<chat_id>/uploads/<sha256>-<name>``.
The ``.chat`` prefix keeps user file trees clean and gives a single delete
target on chat removal.
